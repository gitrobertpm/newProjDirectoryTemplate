# newProjDirectoryTemplate
A basic directory template for starting a new project

To simplify, automate and speed up the process of beginning a new project, I have a new project directory sitting on my desktop.  It's still fairly small and basic, but has grown and mutated over time, and I imagine that process is far from complete.
But so far...

**Directory includes**

- 1 basic **index.html** starter file  
  - essential link and meta tags
  - basic body structure w/ a wrapped header, nav, div and footer
- 1 **assets** sub-directory
  - a collection of illustrator files containing basic wireframes and some Material Design resources
- 1 empty **img** sub-directory
- 1 **css** sub-directory
  - a **myStyles.css** starter with a few general resets and pre-commented sections
  - a **responsive.css** starter for media queries, mobile-first with several pre-comented sections for different window sizes
- 1 **js** sub-directory
  - **jquery.min.js - https://jquery.com/**
  - **Chart.min.js** - http://www.chartjs.org/, an amazing chart and graph library
  - **smoothscroll.js** - https://github.com/galambalazs/smoothscroll-for-websites, a cool library that helps pages do just what the title suggests
  - **classList.min.js** - https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js, a poly fill that helps **IE** work with the **classList method** (doesn't work in **IE 7 or older**)
  - **myScripts.js**, a bare bones starter file with a few general variables and pre-commented sections  

I am mainly using this repository as a back-up and master file of sorts.

I hope to add and refine this collection over time.

Feel welcome to use any of this if it helps you.  I only ask that you respect and follow any licensing requirements.
